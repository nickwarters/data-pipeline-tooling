# Selection processors & the lazy cross-feed join

This documents the `Processor` primitives that drive the **Selection** workload —
`Filter`, `Score`, `Sort`, `Rename` — and `JoinWith`, the cross-feed join that
holds a **lazy reference to another builder** (#9). For the *why*, see
[ADR-0002](adr/0002-python-only-processing-dumb-store-two-tier-carrier.md)
(Python-only processing) and
[ADR-0003](adr/0003-deferred-fluent-builder-composition-model.md) (deferred
builder, joins as lazy references); for the surrounding primitives and the
`SchemaCoercion` processor, [core-primitives.md](core-primitives.md) and
[schema-enforcement.md](schema-enforcement.md).

## What a processor is

A `Processor` is an engine-confined transform run mid-pipeline — it takes the
bulk-tier `DataHandle` and returns a transformed one:

```python
class Processor(Protocol):
    def process(self, handle: DataHandle) -> DataHandle: ...
```

It is attached with `.with_processor(...)` and runs as the builder's `process`
step, in attach order, between the pre- and post-validators. Unlike the
structural validators it is **engine-confined** — a transform needs the engine's
vectorised operations, so it reaches the backing frame via
`to_pandas()`/`from_pandas()` exactly as a Reader/Writer does (ADR-0002). A
processor has **no severity**: a transform either applies or it can't, so a
failure is always fail-fast (ADR-0007) — it raises and the run aborts.

These five are the **Selection** transforms (the `filter/score/sort/join` of
`CONTEXT.md`): the Selection Pipeline reads the **CasePool**, narrows and ranks
it, joins in Reference Data, and emits the **SelectionPool**. The
`SchemaCoercion` processor (#23) is documented separately —
[schema-enforcement.md](schema-enforcement.md).

## Business rules are plain Python, not SQL

`Filter` and `Score` carry their business rule as a **plain-Python callable over
a row mapping** (`{column: value}`), not a SQL string or a column-operator DSL.
This is ADR-0002 made concrete: all business logic happens in Python, and the
store stays dumb. The rule is ordinary Python and never names the engine — the
processor applies it row-wise behind the `DataHandle` seam:

```python
RowPredicate = Callable[[Mapping[str, Any]], bool]   # Filter
RowScorer    = Callable[[Mapping[str, Any]], Any]     # Score
```

Volumes are small (≤ ~1M rows per feed/run — ADR-0002), so row-wise application
is fine; chunking/streaming is explicitly deferred.

### `Filter` — narrow the rows

Keeps only the rows for which the predicate is true (the narrowing half of
Selection — eligibility/availability criteria computed in Python):

```python
from framework.processors import Filter

# keep cases scored at least 10
Filter(lambda row: row["score"] >= 10)
```

An empty feed in yields an empty feed out (no error) — realistic when an upstream
filter has already matched nothing.

### `Score` — rank the rows

Computes a column from each row via a scorer; every other column is untouched. A
new column name adds; an existing one overwrites:

```python
from framework.processors import Score

# derive a priority from the row's amount
Score("priority", lambda row: row["amount"] * 2)
```

### `Sort` — order the rows

Orders rows so a downstream "top N" is meaningful. `by` is a column or a sequence
of them; `ascending` a single flag or a matching sequence. The sorted handle's
index is reset (`0..n-1`) so it reads positionally clean and no stale source
order leaks through to storage:

```python
from framework.processors import Sort

Sort("priority", ascending=False)        # highest first
Sort(["region", "priority"])             # by region, then priority
```

### `Rename` — align column vocabulary

Renames columns by an `{old: new}` mapping; columns the mapping doesn't name pass
through in place and in order. Typically used to make two feeds agree on a key
name before a join:

```python
from framework.processors import Rename

Rename({"ref": "case_ref", "amt": "amount"})
```

## `JoinWith` — the lazy cross-feed join

A Case Type's Selection joins against other feeds — most commonly **Reference
Data** (the Adviser hierarchy, product codes, mappings), which is read-only to
Case Types and joined in Python, never written by them (`CONTEXT.md`, ADR-0002).
`JoinWith` is that join, and it is a `Processor`:

```python
from framework.processors import JoinWith

JoinWith(reference_builder, on="adviser", how="inner")
```

- `other` — a **lazy reference to another builder**: any `Runnable`
  (`run() -> DataHandle`), typically a read-only `Pipeline` over another
  subject's silver/gold (a `Store.reader(...)` with **no** writer, so `.run()`
  just returns that feed's handle).
- `on` — the shared key column(s).
- `how` — the join kind: `inner` (default — unmatched rows dropped),
  `left`/`right`/`outer`.

### Lazy: a DAG without a DAG engine

The defining property (ADR-0003): `other` is **not executed when `JoinWith` is
constructed**. The reference stays unexecuted until the join's `process` step
runs `other.run()`, materialises that feed, and merges the two in Python. So a
pipeline that joins another feed is a small **DAG** — two builders resolved at
one `.run()` — expressed behind a linear-looking fluent surface, with no separate
DAG engine to build.

To keep `JoinWith` from importing the builder (which imports this module — a
cycle), the reference is held through a structural `Runnable` Protocol
(`run() -> DataHandle`) rather than the concrete `Pipeline` class. Naming the
*shape* is what lets the join carry any unexecuted builder.

## Worked example — filter one feed, join another's silver

A Selection-shaped pipeline: read one subject's silver CasePool, narrow it in
Python, and join another subject's silver Reference Data via a lazy `JoinWith`.

```python
from framework.builder import Pipeline
from framework.processors import Filter, JoinWith
from framework.store import Store

cases = Store("/path/to/share/cases")
advisers = Store("/path/to/share/advisers")

# The other feed is an *unexecuted* read-only builder (no writer).
reference = Pipeline("advisers", advisers.reader("silver", "advisers"))

selection_pool = (
    Pipeline("cases", cases.reader("silver", "cases"))
    .with_processor(Filter(lambda row: row["amount"] >= 50))   # narrow (Python)
    .with_processor(JoinWith(reference, on="adviser"))          # join Reference Data
    .run()                                                      # resolves the DAG
)
```

At `.run()` the outer pipeline reads `cases` silver, filters it, then the
`JoinWith` step runs the `reference` builder, reads `advisers` silver, and merges
on `adviser` — all in Python, the store never asked to join. The result is the
bulk-tier `DataHandle` the Selection Pipeline would accumulate into gold as the
SelectionPool (via [`silver_to_gold`](gold-accumulation.md)).

## Not yet (follow-on tickets)

- **The domain capstone** (#11): `CaseType`/`Variation` + `CasePool` →
  `SelectionPool`, which composes these processors into a Case Type's declared
  selection criteria and surfaces typed `Case` objects at the domain edge.
- **Lineage checkpoints** (`.checkpoint(writer)`): persisting an intermediate
  layer mid-pipeline, the other half of the deferred-builder terminus story.
