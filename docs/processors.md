# Processors — the Selection & Ingest transforms

This documents the concrete `Processor` primitives in `framework.processors`.
They fall into two workload families:

- **Selection narrowing** (#9, #62) — `Filter`, `Score`, `Sort`, `Rename`,
  `Stamp`, the per-group `TopNPerGroup` / `SamplePerGroup`, and `JoinWith`, the
  cross-feed join that holds a **lazy reference to another builder**. The
  Selection Pipeline reads the **CasePool**, narrows and ranks it, joins in
  Reference Data, and emits the **SelectionPool**.
- **Ingest & fan-out reshaping** (#35, #36, #39) — `SelectColumns`, `Unpivot`,
  `DeriveKey`, `LatestPerKey`: the transforms that fan one wide feed into a Case
  table and its Detail Tables, derive the deterministic `case_id`, and reduce
  accumulated history to current-state gold (ADR-0009).

For the *why*, see
[ADR-0002](adr/0002-python-only-processing-dumb-store-two-tier-carrier.md)
(Python-only processing),
[ADR-0003](adr/0003-deferred-fluent-builder-composition-model.md) (deferred
builder, joins as lazy references), and
[ADR-0009](adr/0009-case-identity-and-gold-grain.md) (case identity, gold grain,
multi-table feeds). The schema-driven `SchemaCoercion` processor lives with the
schema and is documented separately — [core-primitives.md](core-primitives.md)
and [schema-enforcement.md](schema-enforcement.md).

## What a processor is

A `Processor` is an engine-confined transform run mid-pipeline — it takes the
bulk-tier `Dataset` and returns a transformed one:

```python
class Processor(Protocol):
    def process(self, dataset: Dataset) -> Dataset: ...
```

It is attached with `.with_processor(...)` and runs as the builder's `process`
step, in attach order, between the pre- and post-validators. Unlike the
structural validators it is **engine-confined** — a transform needs the engine's
vectorised operations, so it reaches the backing frame via
`to_pandas()`/`from_pandas()` exactly as a Reader/Writer does (ADR-0002). A
processor has **no severity**: a transform either applies or it can't, so a
failure is always fail-fast (ADR-0007) — it raises and the run aborts.

The sections below cover the **Selection** transforms first (the
`filter/score/sort/join` of `CONTEXT.md`): the Selection Pipeline reads the
**CasePool**, narrows and ranks it, joins in Reference Data, and emits the
**SelectionPool**. The **Ingest & fan-out** transforms follow. The
`SchemaCoercion` processor (#23) is documented separately —
[schema-enforcement.md](schema-enforcement.md).

## Business rules are plain Python, not SQL

`Filter` and `Score` carry their business rule as a **plain-Python callable over
a row mapping** (`{column: value}`), not a SQL string or a column-operator DSL.
This is ADR-0002 made concrete: all business logic happens in Python, and the
store stays dumb. The rule is ordinary Python and never names the engine — the
processor applies it row-wise behind the `Dataset` seam:

```python
RowPredicate = Callable[[Mapping[str, Any]], bool]   # Filter
RowScorer    = Callable[[Mapping[str, Any]], Any]     # Score
```

Volumes are small (≤ ~1M rows per feed/run — ADR-0002), so row-wise application
is fine; chunking/streaming is explicitly deferred.

### Authoring selection rules

Selection rules should be written so the Selection trace can explain them and a
reader can test them without booting a whole Pipeline:

- **Name every explainable gate**: pass `name=` to `Filter` and `JoinWith` when
  the processor may exclude a Case. Use the business reason, e.g.
  `name="high-value"` or `name="adviser-hierarchy"`, not an implementation note.
  Unnamed gates still run, but the trace can only report a generic label.
- **Keep predicates and scorers pure**: make them deterministic functions of the
  row mapping and explicit constants. Do not read the clock, open files, query a
  database, mutate module state, or depend on run order inside the callable. Pass
  run-level facts in as ordinary constants when constructing the pipeline.
- **Extract repeated rules into helpers**: if the same expression appears in two
  gates, or a scorer shares sub-calculation with a predicate, move it to a named
  function. The function name becomes documentation, and the rule can be tested
  independently.
- **Test rule functions directly**: a predicate/scorer is just Python, so unit
  tests can call it with a small `dict` row. Use full Pipeline tests for the
  wiring: score column present, filter named in the trace, rank/order correct,
  and the SelectionPool write.
- **Budget for row-wise Python**: `Filter` and `Score` call your function once
  per row via the backing engine. That keeps business logic portable and
  debuggable, but a slow callable scales linearly with row count. Avoid network
  calls, disk I/O, expensive parsing, and repeated reference lookups in the row
  function; pre-compute reference data before the processor or use `JoinWith`.

```python
from typing import Any, Mapping

from framework.processors import Filter, Score


def high_value_case(row: Mapping[str, Any]) -> bool:
    return row["amount"] >= 100


def priority_score(row: Mapping[str, Any]) -> int:
    return row["amount"] * 2


pipeline = (
    pipeline
    .with_processor(Score("priority_score", priority_score))
    .with_processor(Filter(high_value_case, name="high-value"))
)
```

### `Filter` — narrow the rows

Keeps only the rows for which the predicate is true (the narrowing half of
Selection — eligibility/availability criteria computed in Python):

```python
from framework.processors import Filter


def high_score(row):
    return row["score"] >= 10


# keep cases scored at least 10
Filter(high_score, name="high-score")
```

An empty feed in yields an empty feed out (no error) — realistic when an upstream
filter has already matched nothing.

An optional `name=` labels the eligibility gate so Selection explainability can
record *which* filter excluded a Case — `Filter(high_value_case,
name="high-value")`. Unnamed filters still work; see
[`selection.md`](selection.md) for the per-Case trace (#53).

### `Score` — rank the rows

Computes a column from each row via a scorer; every other column is untouched. A
new column name adds; an existing one overwrites:

```python
from framework.processors import Score


def priority_score(row):
    return row["amount"] * 2


# derive a priority from the row's amount
Score("priority", priority_score)
```

### `Sort` — order the rows

Orders rows so a downstream "top N" is meaningful. `by` is a column or a sequence
of them; `ascending` a single flag or a matching sequence. The sorted dataset's
index is reset (`0..n-1`) so it reads positionally clean and no stale source
order leaks through to storage:

```python
from framework.processors import Sort

Sort("priority", ascending=False)        # highest first
Sort(["region", "priority"])             # by region, then priority
```

### `Rename` — align column vocabulary

Renames columns by an `{old: new}` mapping; columns the mapping doesn't name pass
through in place and in order. Typically used to make two feeds agree on a key
name before a join:

```python
from framework.processors import Rename

Rename({"ref": "case_ref", "amt": "amount"})
```

### `Stamp` — write a constant column

Writes one constant value onto every row. Where `Score` derives a column from
each row, `Stamp` records a single run-level constant — chiefly the applicable
`question_bank_id` a Variation resolves (`CONTEXT.md`) — so the stamp reads as
the constant it is, not a degenerate scorer. The column is added (or overwritten)
even on an empty feed, so the SelectionPool's shape is stable whether or not any
Case was selected:

```python
from framework.processors import Stamp

Stamp("question_bank_id", variation.question_bank_id)
```

## `JoinWith` — the lazy cross-feed join

A Case Type's Selection joins against other feeds — most commonly **Reference
Data** (the Adviser hierarchy, product codes, mappings), which is read-only to
Case Types and joined in Python, never written by them (`CONTEXT.md`, ADR-0002).
`JoinWith` is that join, and it is a `Processor`:

```python
from framework.processors import JoinWith

JoinWith(reference_builder, on="adviser", how="inner")
```

- `other` — a **lazy reference to another builder**: any `Runnable`
  (`run() -> Dataset`), typically a read-only `Pipeline` over another
  subject's silver/gold (a `Store.reader(...)` with **no** writer, so `.run()`
  just returns that feed's dataset).
- `on` — the shared key column(s).
- `how` — the join kind: `inner` (default — unmatched rows dropped),
  `left`/`right`/`outer`, or `cross`.
- `name=` (optional) — labels the join so Selection explainability records a Case
  an *inner* join drops as excluded by this join, rather than silently absent
  (#53; see [`selection.md`](selection.md)).

### Lazy: a DAG without a DAG engine

The defining property (ADR-0003): `other` is **not executed when `JoinWith` is
constructed**. The reference stays unexecuted until the join's `process` step
runs `other.run()`, materialises that feed, and merges the two in Python. So a
pipeline that joins another feed is a small **DAG** — two builders resolved at
one `.run()` — expressed behind a linear-looking fluent surface, with no separate
DAG engine to build.

To keep `JoinWith` from importing the builder (which imports this module — a
cycle), the reference is held through a structural `Runnable` Protocol
(`run() -> Dataset`) rather than the concrete `Pipeline` class. Naming the
*shape* is what lets the join carry any unexecuted builder.

## Worked example — filter one feed, join another's silver

A Selection-shaped pipeline: read one subject's silver CasePool, narrow it in
Python, and join another subject's silver Reference Data via a lazy `JoinWith`.

```python
from framework.builder import Pipeline
from framework.processors import Filter, JoinWith
from framework.store import SILVER, StoreCatalog

catalog = StoreCatalog("/path/to/share")
cases = catalog.store("cases")
advisers = catalog.store("advisers")

# The other feed is an *unexecuted* read-only builder (no writer).
reference = Pipeline("advisers", advisers.reader(SILVER, "advisers"))


def selection_value_case(row):
    return row["amount"] >= 50

selection_pool = (
    Pipeline("cases", cases.reader(SILVER, "cases"))
    .with_processor(Filter(selection_value_case, name="selection-value"))
    .with_processor(JoinWith(reference, on="adviser", name="adviser-reference"))
    .run()                                                      # resolves the DAG
)
```

At `.run()` the outer pipeline reads `cases` silver, filters it, then the
`JoinWith` step runs the `reference` builder, reads `advisers` silver, and merges
on `adviser` — all in Python, the store never asked to join. The result is the
bulk-tier `Dataset` the Selection Pipeline would accumulate into gold as the
SelectionPool (via [`silver_to_gold`](gold-accumulation.md)).

The domain capstone (#11, landed) composes these processors into a Case Type's
full Selection flow — `CaseType`/`Variation` + `CasePool` → `SelectionPool`,
stamping the Variation's `question_bank_id` onto the chosen Cases. See
[`selection.md`](selection.md).

## Per-group narrowing — `TopNPerGroup` and `SamplePerGroup`

Real selection rules reduce each *group* of Cases to at most *N* — "the single
highest-scoring available Case per Adviser", or "sample 5 Cases per region". Two
sibling processors do this (#62; CONTEXT.md **Sampling**). They are separate,
intention-revealing names — not one `mode=` class — in the house style that
keeps `Filter` and `Score` apart, and share a private group-and-cut helper.
`key` is one or more group columns (`str | Sequence[str]`, mirroring
`LatestPerKey`): one adviser, or Adviser × region.

### `TopNPerGroup` — ranked

```python
from framework.processors import TopNPerGroup

# the single highest-scoring Case per adviser
TopNPerGroup(key="adviser", by="score", n=1)
TopNPerGroup(key=["adviser", "region"], by="score", n=3)   # top-3 per group
```

It carries its **own** sort (`by`/`ascending`), so it does not depend on a
preceding `Sort` surviving the grouping, and applies a **stable secondary
tie-break** on `tiebreak` (default `"case_id"` — every Case has one, ADR-0009),
so ranked output is **reproducible when scores tie**.

`TopNPerGroup(key=K, by=B, n=1)` is the structural generalisation of the Ingest
reduction `LatestPerKey(key=K, by=B)` (top-1 per key). They keep separate names
for separate domains — Selection narrowing vs current-state reduction.

### `SamplePerGroup` — seeded random, pure

```python
from framework.processors import SamplePerGroup

SamplePerGroup(key="region", n=5, seed=7)   # 5 Cases per region, reproducibly
```

It is a **pure function** of (input dataset, `seed`) — ADR-0010. The seed is a
fixed, configurable constant, *not* derived from `run_id` or the clock: run-to-run
variation comes from the upstream population shrinking (select-once #60, history
gates), not from varying the randomness. Each group is ordered by `order`
(default `"case_id"`) then drawn via a per-group seed from stdlib hashing
(`hashlib`, stable across Windows/macOS — not the salted builtin `hash`), so the
draw is **invariant to incoming row order** and each group is independent: same
set in + same seed ⇒ same sample out. As-of replay (#53) reconstructs the past
input and re-feeds the same seed to reproduce a past draw.

For both: a group with fewer than `n` rows passes through whole (no error), and
an empty feed in yields an empty feed out (consistent with `Filter`). The
aggregate considered/kept/dropped counts land on the run's `process` step
(`rows_in`/`rows_out`). Exposing the *per-row* dropped reason ("ranked Kth of M",
"not drawn") at the cut point for the explainability trace (#53) is a follow-on.

## Ingest & fan-out processors — multi-table feeds (ADR-0009)

The transforms above narrow the CasePool *into* the SelectionPool. The four
below sit on the other side of the medallion: **Ingest**, where one wide source
feed (650+ columns) is fanned out into a Case table and zero or more **Detail
Tables**, each a single-table pipeline over the shared raw table (#39, #35, #36;
[ADR-0009](adr/0009-case-identity-and-gold-grain.md)). They are ordinary
`Processor`s — same `process(dataset) -> Dataset` shape, same engine-confined,
fail-fast contract — composed on the `raw → silver` and `silver → gold` builders.

### `SelectColumns` — project the columns this pipeline needs

```python
from framework.processors import SelectColumns

SelectColumns(["case_ref", "adviser", "activity_date", "amount"])
```

Keeps only the listed columns and drops the rest. It is the **projection seam**
that keeps each single-table pipeline narrow over a wide shared raw table
(ADR-0009): the Case pipeline projects the Case columns, each Detail pipeline
projects its own slice + the natural key. A requested column that is **absent**
raises `ValueError` naming the missing column(s) and the available ones — so a
mis-typed projection fails at run time rather than silently producing an
incomplete result. (At read time the planned reader `columns=` parameter pushes
the same projection into the `SELECT`; `SelectColumns` is the processor form for
a feed already in memory.)

### `Unpivot` — wide→long, for a Detail Table

```python
from framework.processors import Unpivot

Unpivot(
    id_vars=["case_id"],                 # kept on every output row
    value_vars=[f"product_{i}" for i in range(1, 11)],  # melted into rows
    var_name="product_slot",             # records which source column a row came from
    value_name="product_name",           # holds the value
)
```

Melts a repeated column group (`product_1..10`) into **one row per value**,
keeping the `id_vars` on each — the wide→long reshape that turns a wide feed's
repeated section into a Detail Table at its own finer grain (many lines per
Case). `var_name` labels the column recording *which* source column each row came
from; `value_name` the column holding the value. With `drop_empty=True` (the
default), rows whose value is `None` or an empty/whitespace-only string are
dropped — the usual case for `product 1..10` feeds where unoccupied slots are
blank. Pass `drop_empty=False` to keep them.

### `DeriveKey` — stamp the deterministic `case_id`

```python
import uuid
from framework.processors import DeriveKey

namespace = uuid.uuid5(uuid.NAMESPACE_DNS, "wide_cases")  # the case-type namespace
DeriveKey(into="case_id", namespace=namespace, natural_key=["case_ref"])
```

Computes `uuid5(namespace, natural_key_string)` for every row and writes it into
the `into` column (new or overwrite). The natural-key string joins the `str()` of
each `natural_key` column's value with `"|"`, in declared order — so the **same
values always produce the same UUID on every run and every machine** (pure stdlib
`uuid`, no platform variance). This is the deterministic `case_id` of ADR-0009:
because the Case pipeline and each Detail pipeline derive it from the *same*
`namespace` + `natural_key`, a Detail row links back to its Case with **no join**
and idempotency holds across runs. (Contrast `Stamp`, which writes one constant;
`DeriveKey` computes a per-row key from the row's natural-key columns.)

### `LatestPerKey` — collapse accumulated history to current state

```python
from framework.processors import LatestPerKey

LatestPerKey(key="case_id", by="load_date")
```

Keeps the **latest row per `key`**, where "latest" is the maximum `by` value (a
timestamp or load column). `key` is one column or a list. This is the
*current-gold* reduction of the history-upstream / current-gold Ingest profile
(ADR-0006 amendment): raw + silver accumulate the change-over-time record, and
`LatestPerKey` reduces accumulated silver to the one-row-per-Case current state
the CasePool reads. **Tie-break:** when rows for a key share the maximum `by`
value, the row appearing **last in the input** is kept — deterministic given a
stable input order (accumulating silver is appended in load order, so the last
tied row is the most recently appended). A missing `key`/`by` column raises
`ValueError`. Structurally this is `TopNPerGroup(key, by, n=1)`; the two keep
separate names for separate domains — Ingest current-state reduction vs Selection
narrowing.

### Worked example — fanning one wide feed into a Case table + Detail Table

These processors are composed both **directly** on a pipeline (`SelectColumns`,
`Unpivot`) and **inside** the ingest gold builders (`ingest_silver_to_gold` wires
`DeriveKey → LatestPerKey → UniqueValidator`; `detail_ingest_silver_to_gold`
wires `DeriveKey → Unpivot`, with **no** `LatestPerKey` because a Detail Table
keeps many lines per Case). The full path — one wide CSV → a `cases` gold table +
a `case_products` Detail Table — is the runnable
[`../pipelines/demo_fan_out.py`](../pipelines/demo_fan_out.py):

```sh
python -m pipelines.demo_fan_out /tmp/demo_fan_out
```

```python
# Cases pipeline: shared raw → project case columns → coerce/validate → silver
(
    Pipeline("cases", store.reader("raw", SUBJECT))
    .with_processor(Filter(lambda row: row["run_id"] == RUN_ID))
    .with_processor(Rename({"case_ref_no": "case_ref"}))     # shared normalisation
    .with_processor(SelectColumns(["case_ref", "adviser", "activity_date", "amount"]))
    .with_processor(SchemaCoercion(CaseSchema))
    .with_post_validator(SchemaValidator(CaseSchema))
    .write_to(store.writer("silver", "cases", AccumulateByRun(RUN_ID, RUN_ID)))
    .run()
)
# Cases gold: DeriveKey → LatestPerKey → UniqueValidator → current-only gold
ingest_silver_to_gold(store, "cases", namespace=CASE_NAMESPACE, natural_key=["case_ref"]).run()

# Products Detail Table gold: DeriveKey (same namespace + key) → Unpivot wide→long
detail_ingest_silver_to_gold(
    store, "case_products", namespace=CASE_NAMESPACE, natural_key=["case_ref"],
    unpivot=Unpivot(id_vars=["case_id"], value_vars=PRODUCT_COLS,
                    var_name="product_slot", value_name="product_name"),
).run()
```

Both pipelines read the *same* raw table and share one `Rename` normalisation
instance; each is independently validated and writes its own gold. See
[gold-accumulation.md](gold-accumulation.md) for the gold builders and
[ADR-0009](adr/0009-case-identity-and-gold-grain.md) for the fan-out rationale.

## Not yet (follow-on tickets)

- **Typed `Case` objects** at the domain edge: the CasePool returns the bulk-tier
  `Dataset` today; materialising fully typed Cases on demand is reserved for a
  later slice (ADR-0002).
- **Lineage checkpoints** (`.checkpoint(writer)`): persisting an intermediate
  layer mid-pipeline, the other half of the deferred-builder terminus story.
